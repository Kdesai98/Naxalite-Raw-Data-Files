These are all the raw data files for the paper "Infrastructure in India’s Internal War: A District-Level Analysis of the Naxalite-Maoist Conflict". I have attached the python scripting files as well, in addition to the final clean dataset for running regressions as well to make things easier for the user.
I also added the regression scripts as well so the user may recreate my results very easily.
Lastly, I added the final paper so the user can follow my methodology and results.
